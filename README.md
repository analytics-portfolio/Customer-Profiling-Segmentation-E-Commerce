## 🌐 Overview
The project demonstrates how this customer relationship analytics framework can turn sales and customer service data into insights for smarter business decision-making process. It enhances sales, customer service, and marketing by:
- **Validating Customer Data**: Pinpoint insights for targeted marketing, ensuring the marketing strategy reach the right audience.
- **Understanding Customer Behavior**: Learn spending patterns and preferences to tailor marketing efforts.
- **Boosting Lead Generation**: Identify which marketing tactics drive sales and apply them more broadly to potentially increase revenue.

This simple combination of RFM clustering model with data transformation identify high-value customers, developing retention strategies, and optimizing marketing efforts to increase customer loyalty and revenue.

This dataset includes all transactions occurring between 2010 and 2011 from a UK-based retailer available at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/352/online+retail).
